      The series 592 originally consisted of 70 trains, of which, in May 2007, 
      45 are assigned to Media Distance services and 23 to those of Cercan&#237;as. 
      These diesel cars were built between 1981 and 1984 by Macosa and Ateinsa 
      (now Alstom) and assigned to the Valencia-Fuente de San Luis and 
      Zaragoza deposits.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this series, Renfe undertook in the early 1980s the replacement of 
      its diesel auto fleet composed until then by ferries, with few seats and 
      reliability, and the Ter, which were approaching the end of their life 
      cycle and counting With an excessive supply of seats of 1st class.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the decade of the 80s a first remodeling of this series 
      was realized before the necessity of introducing them in services of 
      great mileage, reason why 20 of them received seats of 1&#170; class in the 
      trailer car and a small cafeteria in ones of The motor cars, operation 
      that was carried out in the TCR of Valladolid. Under the name of &quot;Fast 
      Automotive&quot; these trains came to link Madrid with Valencia and Gand&#237;a, 
      with Leon and Ferrol, and with Algeciras. They also circulated between 
      Bilbao and A Coru&#241;a and between Valencia-Irun / Bilbao.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1994, at that time, UN de Regionales decided to redeploy all the 
      trains in the series, for which it bought new Man engines, the D 2866 
      LUE, which could give up to 230 kW of useful power, although from its 
      installation were lowered to 210 kW so as not to damage your Voith 
      transmission.
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 31, 1996, 23 trains of this series were transferred to 
      Cercan&#237;as, leaving the series divided in an official way by the 
      specialization of its services.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the decade of 1990, the then UN of Cercan&#237;as decided to 
      approach a modernization of these automotive, being realized the works 
      in the TCR of Valladolid. This modernization was intended to increase 
      the reliability of this material by incorporating new diesel engines of 
      the D type 2866 LUE of greater power and various technical improvements, 
      as well as offer to the traveler a series of benefits similar to those 
      of the trains of the series 446 and 447.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diesel vehicles 592 of Media Distance were subject, from 2002, to a 
      major remodeling, giving rise to the series 592-2, integrated by 27 
      units. This remodeling, consisting of the remodeling and interior 
      design, has allowed an increase of the interior comfort and an increase 
      of its benefits. The remodeling, which was carried out at the Central 
      Repair Workshop in Valladolid, consisted of the installation of new Man 
      engines with the improved cooling system, increasing the maximum speed 
      to 140 km / h.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minimum autonomous composition consists of three cars (Engine + 
      Trailer + Engine) and the maximum composition of three units, which can 
      be controlled from a single driving station.
